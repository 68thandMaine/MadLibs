  <p>Thanksgiving with you @Model.GetNoun1() can be a/an @Model.GetAdjective1 experience, but you've got to come prepared.</p>
  <p>Don't show up at your parents' @Model.GetNoun2() expecting everything to be peaches 'n' @Model.GetNoun3().</p>
  <p>Make a plan.</p>
  <p>First go to the kitchen and help your mother cook the gigantic @Model.GetNoun4() she bought.</p>
  <p>Then greet each individual @Model.GetNoun5() at the door, take their @Model.GetPluralNoun1, and seat them at least @Model.GetNumber1 feet away from each other.</p>
  <p>Start the conversation by asing Dad about his @Model.GetAdjective2 old days as the @Model.GetNoun6 of his high-school @Model.GetNoun7() (Anything to make him forget that you still owe @Model.GetNumber2() dollars for your tuition.)</p>
  <p>It will also keep your grandparents from talking, this sparing you the lecture on the "outrageous prince of @Model.GetPluralNoun2 these days."</p>
  <p>Finally - and please dont overlook this very @Model.GetAdjective3() step - bring proof that you looked for a job in the past week!</p>
